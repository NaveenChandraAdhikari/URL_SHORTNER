/*
We override the loadUserByUsername method in UserDetailsService to define how to fetch user details (e.g., username, password, roles) from our specific data source (e.g., database). Here's why:
Key Reasons:

    Custom Data Source:
        Spring Security doesnâ€™t know how to get user information from your database or data store.
        By overriding loadUserByUsername, you provide the logic to fetch the user details (e.g., from a database, API, etc.).

    Custom User Logic:
        You can specify what information is required for authentication, such as roles, status, or any other fields unique to your application.

    Enable Spring Security:
        Spring Security uses loadUserByUsername to fetch the user, verify their credentials, and authenticate them.
        Without this, Spring Security won't know how to validate users in your system.

Simple Example:

Suppose your app has a User table in a database. To fetch user details, you'd:

    Query the database for the username.
    Convert the result into a UserDetails object (with username, password, and roles).
